- [[Hypothalamus]], [[Anterior Pituitary|anterior pituitary]], [[Adrenal Cortex|adrenal cortex]]
- Hormones involved: 
	- CRF (Corticotropin Releasing Factor)
	- ACTH (AdrenoCortico[[Hormones|Tropic]] Hormone)
	- Glucocorticoids
		- Cortisol: in humans
		- Cortisone: in rodents
		- [[Types of Hormones|Steroid Hormones]]

- What is it:
	- The main stress response system (Dunlavey 2018)
	- Modulates metabolism, immune responses, and [[Nervous System Organization|ANS (autonomic nervous system)]]
	- Basic explanation:
		- Hypothalamus releases CRF
		- Stimulates anterior pituitary to release ACTH
		- Stimulates adrenal cortex to release glucocorticoids (ie cortisol)

***MCAT students: this is all you need to know***

# Hypothalamus: PVN

- PVN: paraventricular [[Nervous System Organization|nucleus]]
	- Contains three types of neurons (parvocellular, neurosecretory magnocellular, [[Posterior Pituitary|long-projecting neurons]]) that are characterized by electrophysiological properties
		- Parvocellular neurons: [[Low Threshold Depolarization|low threshold depolarization]]
			- Works differently than the stereotypical [[Action Potentials|action potential ]]
				- Open up Ca2+ channels
			- **Release CRF and [[Thyroid Axis|TRH]]**
		- Magnocellular neurons: return to baseline after depolarizing stimuli
	- Integrates converging [[Action Potentials|stimulating or inhibiting]] or inputs
		- Primary stimulating: [[Adrenal medulla|catecholamines]], glutamatergic, or seratonegic inputs
- SCN
	- Orchestrates the [[circadian rhythm]] of the HPA Axis

# Stress Physiology - What do GCs do?

- [[Fatty Acid Metabolism|Lipolysis]] and [[Protein metabolism|proteolysis]], vasoconstriction, alter stress-related behaviors, suppress reproduction 
- Deleterious effects: immune function, cardiovascular health, metabolic functions, neural
	- Chronic exposure has effects on multiple conditions, specifically pertaining: neurodegeneration

## GCs and Immune Cells
- GRs are pervasive throughout all cells of the [[Immune System|immune system]]
	- Phagocytes: Increases phagocytotic potential of monocytes and macrophages
	- Suppresses immunostimulatory functions and decreases production of pro-inflammatory factors
