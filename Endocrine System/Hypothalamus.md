- "CPU" of [[EndocrineSystem|endocrine system]]
	- Regulates the synthesis and secretion of many hormones
- Located under the **thalamus**
- Primarily influences activity in the [[Pituitary Gland|pituitary gland]] through [[Peptide Hormones]]
- Interacts with **[[Anterior Pituitary]]** through the hypophyseal [[Portal System]]

# Hormones


PVN: paraventricular [[Nervous System Organization|nucleus]]
	- Contains three types of neurons (parvocellular, neurosecretory magnocellular, [[Posterior Pituitary|long-projecting neurons]]) that are characterized by electrophysiological properties
		- Parvocellular neurons: [[Low Threshold Depolarization|low threshold depolarization]]
			- Works differently than the stereotypical [[Action Potentials|action potential ]]
				- Open up Ca2+ channels
			- **Release CRF and [[Thyroid Axis|TRH]]**
		- Magnocellular neurons: return to baseline after depolarizing stimuli
	- Integrates converging [[Action Potentials|stimulating or inhibiting]] or inputs
		- Primary stimulating: [[Adrenal medulla|catecholamines]], glutamatergic, or seratonegic inputs
- SCN
	- Orchestrates the [[circadian rhythm]] of the HPA Axis
