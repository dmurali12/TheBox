- [[Public/Endocrine System/Hypothalamus]], [[Public/Endocrine System/Anterior Pituitary|anterior pituitary]], [[Public/Endocrine System/Adrenal Cortex|adrenal cortex]]
- Hormones involved: 
	- CRF (Corticotropin Releasing Factor)
	- ACTH (AdrenoCortico[[Public/Endocrine System/Hormones|Tropic]] Hormone)
	- Glucocorticoids
		- Cortisol: in humans
		- Cortisone: in rodents
		- [[Public/Endocrine System/Types of Hormones|Steroid Hormones]]

- What is it:
	- The main stress response system (Dunlavey 2018)
	- Modulates metabolism, immune responses, and [[Nervous System Organization|ANS (autonomic nervous system)]]
	- Basic explanation:
		- Hypothalamus releases CRF
		- Stimulates anterior pituitary to release ACTH
		- Stimulates adrenal cortex to release glucocorticoids (ie cortisol)

# Stress Physiology - What do GCs do?

- [[Fatty Acid Metabolism|Lipolysis]] and [[Protein metabolism|proteolysis]], vasoconstriction, alter stress-related behaviors, suppress reproduction 
- Deleterious effects: immune function, cardiovascular health, metabolic functions, neural
	- Chronic exposure has effects on multiple conditions, specifically pertaining: neurodegeneration

## GCs and Immune Cells
- GRs are pervasive throughout all cells of the [[Immune System|immune system]]
	- Phagocytes: Increases phagocytotic potential of monocytes and macrophages
	- Suppresses immunostimulatory functions and decreases production of pro-inflammatory factors
