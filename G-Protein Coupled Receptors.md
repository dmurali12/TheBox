- Associate with [[heterotrimeric]] [[G-proteins]]
- Binds extracellular ligands and triggers [[conformational changes]] 

[[G-proteins|How do G proteins work?]]

- When inactive, α subunit is bound to [[Guanosine Phosphates | guanosine diphosphate (GDP)]]
- When GPCR is activated, α subunit *releases* GDP and binds to **GTP**
	- Results in a [[conformational changes|conformational change]] and *activates G protein*
	- α subunit acts as a **GTPase**, so it is inactive when bound to **GDP**
