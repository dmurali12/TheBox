- How organs and tissues communicate with each other
- Allows organisms to respond to changes in internal and external stimuli to maintain homeostasis
- Relies on hormonal communication
- Influenced by and influences the [[Nervous System|nervous system]]

# Hormones
- Molecules produced by the endocrine glands
	- [[Hypothalamus]]
	- Pituitary gland
	- Adrenal glands
	- Gonads
	- Thyroid gland
	- Parathyroid gland
- Importantly, **hormones are released into the bloodstream**

Hormones are known as either **tropic** or **direct** depending on what they act on.
- **Tropic** hormones act on *other glands*, regulating the release of hormones from that gland
- **Direct** hormones act on the *target tissue*

## Mechanisms of Action

- **Autocrine** signaling: the signal acts on the cell that *released* the signal
	- "Auto" = self
- **Paracrine** signaling: signal diffuses through the **interstitial fluid** to act on nearby cell
- **Endocrine** signaling is when hormones *travel **through** the bloodstream*

# Hormone Systems
The glands listed above and their hormones act together to maintain ***homeostasis*** within the body. Generally, many of these axes follow this pattern:
1. [[Hypothalamus]] sends signal (could be electrical or endocrine) in response to internal or external factors
2. Pituitary gland releases endocrine signal
3. Signal travels to and acts on target tissue

## [[Pituitary Gland]]

The pituitary gland has two lobes: the ***anterior** pituitary* and the ***posterior** pituitary*. How the hypothalamus sends the signal depends on which lobe the axis utilizes. 

### [[Anterior Pituitary]]
The [[Anterior Pituitary|anterior pituitary]] (AP) is made of glandular tissue that can both synthesize and secrete **tropic** [[Peptide Hormones|peptide hormones]]. The hypothalamus releases ***releasing*** and ***inhibiting*** factors into the ***hypophyseal [[portal system]]***.  
- Hypothalamus sends ==endocrine hormones to anterior pituitary==

#### Axes Involving Anterior Pituitary


### [[Posterior Pituitary]]
The [[posterior pituitary]] only *stores* hormones that the *hypothalamus produces*. The hypothalamus sends axons down into the posterior pituitary. When depolarized, the posterior pituitary releases the hormones (known as **neurohormones**) from the [[Neuron Structure|axon terminals]]. 













whether the axis uses the [[Anterior Pituitary|anterior pituitary]] or the [[Posterior Pituitary|posterior pituitary]].
