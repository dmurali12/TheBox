- How organs and tissues communicate with each other
- Allows organisms to respond to changes in internal and external stimuli to maintain homeostasis
- Relies on hormonal communication
- Influenced by and influences the [[Nervous System|nervous system]]

# Hormones
- Molecules produced by the endocrine glands
	- [[Hypothalamus]]
	- Pituitary gland
	- Adrenal glands
	- Gonads
	- Thyroid gland
	- Parathyroid gland
- Importantly, **hormones are released into the bloodstream**

Hormones are known as either **tropic** or **direct** depending on what they act on.
- **Tropic** hormones act on *other glands*, regulating the release of hormones from that gland
- **Direct** hormones act on the *target tissue*

## Mechanisms of Action

- **Autocrine** signaling: the signal acts on the cell that *released* the signal
	- "Auto" = self
- **Paracrine** signaling: signal diffuses through the **interstitial fluid** to act on nearby cell
- **Endocrine** signaling is when hormones *travel **through** the bloodstream*
